        Learning becomes super easy when you try to build something that makes you feel good. I know this sounds a bit cliche, at some point things become boring, and that's the main game to play. It's about dealing with boredom but also figuring things out to make them interesting for you and that's itâ€”you'll achieve your goal one day, and then move on to the next goal. This is life :)
